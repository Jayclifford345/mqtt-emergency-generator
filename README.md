# MQTT Emergency Generator Simulator

This repoistory will allow you to spin up Emergency Generators producing fake IoT data. Each generator will write to its own MQTT topic the following values: 

1. Load
2. Voltage
3. Fuel Level
4. Temperature

The payload will look like this:

```json
{"generatorID": "generator1", "lat": 40.68066, "lon": -73.47429, "temperature": 186, "power": 186, "load": 2, "fuel": 277}
```

There are two ways to setup this Sim: Docker + Locally
